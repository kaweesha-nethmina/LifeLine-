### 5. Code Changes

- Removed unused import of expo-av

## Resolved Issues
1. Fixed app.json schema validation issues
2. Resolved duplicate dependencies
3. Installed missing peer dependencies
4. Updated packages to match versions required by Expo SDK 54

## Remaining Warnings
The following non-critical warnings remain:
- Some packages are untested on New Architecture or unmaintained (react-native-file-viewer, react-native-webrtc)
- No metadata available for react-native-vector-icons

These warnings do not affect the functionality of the app and can be addressed separately if needed.

## Testing
After completing the upgrade, run `npx expo-doctor` to verify the project configuration. The upgrade should show 16/17 checks passed with only the non-critical React Native Directory metadata warning remaining.
