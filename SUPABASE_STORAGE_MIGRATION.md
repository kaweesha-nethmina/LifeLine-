# Supabase Storage Migration - Complete Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete migration from Firebase Storage to Supabase Storage in the LifeLinePlus healthcare application, maintaining Firebase Authentication and Firestore for user management and metadata storage.

## Architecture
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth (retained)
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (retained) 
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage (migrated from Firebase Storage)
- **Metadata Storage**: Firebase Firestore collections

## Implementation Details

### 1. Storage Structure
```
healthcare-documents/
├── documents/{userId}/{timestamp_filename}     # Medical documents
└── profiles/{userId}/{timestamp_filename}      # Profile pictures
```

### 2. Supabase Storage Policies
Required policies in Supabase Dashboard:
```sql
-- Allow public read access to healthcare-documents bucket
CREATE POLICY "Public read access" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'healthcare-documents');

-- Allow authenticated insert access
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated upload access" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'healthcare-documents' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow users to update their own files
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own files" ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE USING (bucket_id = 'healthcare-documents' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow users to delete their own files  
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own files" ON storage.objects FOR DELETE USING (bucket_id = 'healthcare-documents' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

### 3. Files Modified

#### A. `src/services/firebase.js`
- **Removed**: Firebase Storage imports and exports
- **Retained**: Firebase Auth and Firestore
- **Added**: Comments indicating Supabase Storage usage

#### B. `src/services/supabase.js`
- **Enhanced**: React Native-compatible file upload using FormData
- **Added**: Profile picture upload/delete functions
- **Added**: Connection testing and debugging utilities

#### C. `src/screens/UploadDocumentScreen.js`
- **Migrated**: Document upload to use Supabase Storage
- **Retained**: Metadata storage in Firebase Firestore
- **Added**: Comprehensive error handling and file validation

#### D. `src/screens/ProfileScreen.js`
- **Added**: Profile picture upload functionality
- **Added**: Camera and gallery image picker integration
- **Added**: Visual feedback for upload progress

#### E. `src/screens/doctor/DoctorProfileScreen.js`
- **Added**: Doctor profile picture upload functionality
- **Added**: Avatar image display and edit capabilities
- **Added**: Upload progress indicators

### 4. Key Features Implemented

#### Document Upload (UploadDocumentScreen)
- ✅ Camera capture for documents
- ✅ Gallery image selection
- ✅ PDF and document file picker
- ✅ Supabase Storage upload
- ✅ Firebase Firestore metadata storage
- ✅ File categorization and organization
- ✅ Delete functionality (both storage and metadata)

#### Profile Picture Upload
- ✅ Camera capture for avatars
- ✅ Gallery image selection  
- ✅ Supabase Storage upload to profiles folder
- ✅ User profile update in Firebase Firestore
- ✅ Visual feedback during upload
- ✅ Old image cleanup on update

### 5. Storage Functions Available

#### Document Functions
```javascript
// Upload document
supabaseStorage.uploadFile(userId, file, fileName)

// Get public URL
supabaseStorage.getPublicUrl(filePath)

// Delete document
supabaseStorage.deleteFile(filePath)

// Create signed URL (for private access)
supabaseStorage.createSignedUrl(filePath, expiresIn)
```

#### Profile Picture Functions
```javascript
// Upload profile picture
supabaseStorage.uploadProfilePicture(userId, imageFile)

// Delete profile picture
supabaseStorage.deleteProfilePicture(filePath)
```

### 6. Error Handling
- **Network failures**: Comprehensive error messages and retry logic
- **File validation**: Size, type, and format validation
- **Upload failures**: Detailed error reporting and user feedback
- **Blob conversion issues**: React Native-specific solutions using FormData

### 7. React Native Compatibility
- **File handling**: Uses URI-based file objects instead of web Blobs
- **Upload method**: FormData with REST API for reliable uploads
- **Image picker**: Expo ImagePicker integration for camera and gallery
- **Progress feedback**: Loading states and upload progress indicators

### 8. Migration Benefits
- **Cost savings**: Supabase Storage more cost-effective than Firebase Storage
- **Performance**: Optimized for React Native file uploads
- **Scalability**: Better handling of large files and concurrent uploads
- **Reliability**: Improved error handling and retry mechanisms

### 9. Environment Configuration
```env
# Supabase Configuration
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://rfgakuzpwnjwysyzppqf.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InJmZ2FrdXpwd25qd3lzeXpwcHFmIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTY4MzU3NDYsImV4cCI6MjA3MjQxMTc0Nn0.q5km-3atFa0ISVOBzfgI_AySVgefQfr-5O-p72-wtuM
```

### 10. Testing Completed
- ✅ Document upload (camera, gallery, file picker)
- ✅ Document deletion 
- ✅ Profile picture upload and update
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android)
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases
- ✅ File size and format validation

## Conclusion
The migration to Supabase Storage is now complete across the entire application. All file upload functionality has been migrated while maintaining the existing Firebase Authentication and Firestore database structure. The hybrid architecture provides the benefits of both platforms while maintaining data consistency and user experience.

## Maintenance Notes
- Monitor Supabase Storage usage and costs
- Regular backup of storage bucket policies
- Update API keys when they expire
- Consider implementing additional security policies as needed
