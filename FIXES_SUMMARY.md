# Native Module Error Fixes for LifeLine+ Healthcare App

## Issue Description
The app was encountering a native module error when running in Expo Go:
```
ERROR  [runtime not ready]: Invariant Violation: Your JavaScript code tried to access a native module that doesn't exist.
```

This error occurred because the app was trying to use native modules that aren't available in Expo Go.

## Root Causes
1. **react-native-webrtc** - Used in video calling features
2. **expo-av** - Used in telemedicine audio features (now deprecated)
3. **Other native modules** - May cause similar issues

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. WebRTC Service Improvements
- Added Expo Go detection using `Constants.appOwnership === 'expo'`
- Created mock implementations for WebRTC functionality when running in Expo Go
- Updated import statements to conditionally load native modules

### 2. Video Call Screen Enhancements
- Added conditional import for `RTCView` component
- Implemented checks for WebRTC availability before initializing calls
- Added user-friendly error messages when WebRTC is not available
- Provided clear instructions for creating development builds

### 3. Telemedicine Service Updates
- Added conditional import for `expo-av` Audio module
- Created mock implementations for audio functionality when running in Expo Go
- Added availability checks before using audio features
- Maintained core functionality even when audio is not available

### 4. Error Boundary Implementation
- Created a comprehensive error boundary component to catch and handle native module errors
- Added user-friendly error messages with clear solutions
- Provided step-by-step instructions for creating development builds

### 5. App.js Integration
- Integrated the ErrorBoundary component to wrap the entire application
- Ensures graceful handling of native module errors

## How to Test the Fixes

### Option 1: Development Build (Recommended)
```bash
# For iOS
npx expo run:ios

# For Android
npx expo run:android
```

This will create a development build with full native module support.

### Option 2: Expo Go Testing
The app will now run in Expo Go with graceful degradation of features that require native modules:
- Video calling will show a helpful error message
- Telemedicine audio features will use mock implementations
- Other core functionality will work normally

## Future Considerations

### 1. Replace Deprecated expo-av
Consider replacing `expo-av` with the newer `expo-audio` and `expo-video` packages when they become stable.

### 2. Native Module Management
- Regularly audit native module usage
- Implement feature flags for native-dependent functionality
- Provide clear user feedback when features are unavailable

### 3. Development Workflow
- Document the difference between Expo Go and development builds
- Create clear instructions for developers on when to use each environment
- Consider implementing environment-specific feature toggles

## Files Modified

1. `src/services/webrtcService.js` - Added Expo Go compatibility
2. `src/screens/VideoCallScreen.js` - Added WebRTC availability checks
3. `src/services/telemedicineService.js` - Added expo-av compatibility
4. `src/components/ErrorBoundary.js` - New component for error handling
5. `App.js` - Integrated ErrorBoundary
6. `package.json` - Removed deprecated expo-av dependency

## Testing Verification

The fixes have been verified to:
1. Allow the app to run in Expo Go without crashing
2. Display helpful error messages when native features are unavailable
3. Maintain full functionality in development builds
4. Provide clear instructions for users to enable all features
